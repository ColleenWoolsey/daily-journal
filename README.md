DAILY JOURNAL PART 1 AND 2

1. Built a form for entering in journal entries.
2. Defined how the data collected in the form would be stored.
3. Built a data structure to represent a journal entry.
4. Built a function that returns an HTML representation of that data structure.
5. Rendered it to the DOM.

DAILY JOURNAL - PART 3
The learning objectives were:
1. To set up JSON Server to store the data for daily journal entries
2. Query that data from the API
3. Use Promises (fetch)
4. Render the entries to the DOM.

DAILY JOURNAL - PART 4

1. Modularized JavaScript code - created data.js, entriesDOM.js and entryComponent.js
2. Refactored journal.js and included new script tags in index.html in correct order

OPTIONAL CHALLENGE
1. Change the code in both src/scripts/entriesDOM.js and src/scripts/entryComponent.js so that the functions in each one becomes a method on an object
2. Once the objects are defined, refactor your code to use the methods on those objects where needed
