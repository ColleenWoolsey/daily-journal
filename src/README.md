DAILY JOURNAL - PART 4
1. Modularized JavaScript code - created data.js, entriesDOM.js and entryComponent.js
2. Refactored journal.js and included new script tags in index.html in correct order
CHALLENGE
1. Change the code in both src/scripts/entriesDOM.js and src/scripts/entryComponent.js so that the functions in each one becomes a method on an object
2. Once the objects are defined, refactor your code to use the methods on those objects where needed
